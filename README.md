# es-test
Repository for SALS quiz

This repo will es launch an AWS VM running a secure ElasticSearch service. 

** Dependencies **
- Use Mac / Linux for ease. 
- You have installed pip. Else, follow https://pip.pypa.io//en/latest/installing/ (You will probably need root privs.)
- You have installed AWS CLI. Else, follow https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ (I suggest something like `sudo -H pip install awscli --upgrade --ignore-installed six` for Mac.)

Just run init.sh.
